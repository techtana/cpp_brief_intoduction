# cpp_brief_intoduction

## Topics covered
* Preprocessor directive (e.g. #include "header_files", macro, define)
* Basic operators e.g. bit shifts (>>, <<), main data types, and other general syntax
* Function: definitions, basic functions e.g. std::out
* Difference between accessing object instance or a function within a class i.e. (dot vs double colons)
* Pointers: referencing and dereferencing memory address
* Constants usage and implication when using with pointers
* Arrays: Stack and Heaps methods
* Classes and Inheritance: accessing member structure i.e. (->), static variables, redefinition of function i.e. virtual function, virtual destructor
* Struct: Similar to class, but everything is public. Commonly used to store data i.e. "data **struct**ure"
* Namespace: global, local, and specifying namespace i.e. `using namespace`
* Header guard and `#Pragma` directive
